# Testing Workflow Plan for ShowerThoughtsFM

## Notes
- ShowerThoughtsFM is a Next.js 14 app using TypeScript, Tailwind, and ElevenLabs for TTS.
- The codebase includes API routes, React components, and utility libraries.
- No existing testing workflow or framework is present yet.

## Task List
- [ ] Decide on a testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright)
- [ ] Set up the chosen testing framework in the project
- [ ] Add sample unit tests for utility functions (e.g., lib/showerThoughts.ts, lib/voice.ts)
- [ ] Add sample component tests (e.g., MoodSelector, Player)
- [ ] Add sample API route tests (e.g., /api/generate)
- [ ] Add test scripts to package.json
- [ ] Document how to run the tests

## Current Goal
Choose and set up a testing framework
